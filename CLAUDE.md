## Development Setup

This project does not yet have a defined technology stack or build system. When setting up the project:

1. Determine the appropriate technology stack based on project requirements

3. Create appropriate configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
4. Set up development scripts for building, testing, and linting

## Project Structure

The project structure is not yet established. Consider organizing code into logical directories such as:
- Source code directory (src/, lib/, app/)
- Configuration files at root level
- Documentation in docs/ or at root level
- Tests in test/, tests/, or __tests__/
