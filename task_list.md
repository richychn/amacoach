### Architecture Overview 🏗️
```
Claude Desktop App (MCP Client)
    ↓ stdio transport
Local MCP Server (server.py)
    ↓ SQLite operations
AmaCoach Database (amacoach.db)

Railway Deployment (HTTP mode)
    ↓ health checks only
Production database (with volume persistence)
```

## 🚀 Next Steps for New Claude Code Session

2. **Complete Git Repository Setup** - Initialize repo and push to GitHub if testing successful  
3. **Address Any MCP Issues** - Debug connection problems or tool functionality
4. **Plan Railway MCP Integration** - If local works, consider WebSocket transport for Railway
5. **Production Documentation** - Create comprehensive setup guides
